# Algorithm Viewer  

Algorithm Viewer is an interactive application designed to visualize famous computer science algorithms such as Dijkstra, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS). The app features an intuitive interface that lets users apply these algorithms to custom-built data structures, making it both educational and engaging.  

This project showcases my frontend development skills and experiments with clean coding practices, adhering to the **SOLID methodology**.

## Features  

### ðŸŽ¯ Algorithm Visualization  
- Visualize classic algorithms like:  
  - **Dijkstra**: Find the shortest path in weighted graphs.  
  - **DFS**: Explore nodes deeply in a depth-wise manner.  
  - **BFS**: Traverse nodes level by level.  

### ðŸ›  Custom Data Structures  
- Build and customize your own data structures.  
- Apply algorithms dynamically and observe their operations in real-time.  

### ðŸ–¥ Clean, User-Friendly Interface  
- Designed for simplicity, making it easy to explore complex concepts.  
- Interactive controls for seamless user experience.

## Future Plans  

While the app is currently on hold as Iâ€™ve returned to college, I plan to use it in the upcoming semester to explore **DevOps concepts**. My focus will include:  
- Implementing **CI/CD pipelines** for efficient testing and deployment.  
- Integrating modern DevOps practices into the app's workflow.

## Technologies Used  

- **Frontend**: React.js with custom hooks and component-driven architecture.  
- **State Management**: Redux for predictable and scalable state management.  
- **Styling**: CSS modules for maintainable and modular styles.  
- **Development Practices**: SOLID methodology and clean code principles.

## How to Use  

1. **Build Your Data Structure**: Use the interface to create nodes and connections.  
2. **Choose an Algorithm**: Select one of the available algorithms to run on the structure.  
3. **Visualize**: Watch the step-by-step execution and gain insights into its workings.

## Development Status  

- **Current Status**:  
  - Development paused while I focus on college studies.  
- **Next Phase**:  
  - DevOps integration in the next semester to implement CI/CD pipelines.
